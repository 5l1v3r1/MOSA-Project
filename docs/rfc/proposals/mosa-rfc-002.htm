      This project is affiliated with MOSA (Managed Operating Systems Alliance).
      Other projects within MOSA may code files within this code repository that
      have the MOSA license header. They are allowed to use the files containing
      the header in the following ways:
      
      o Port it directly to another programming language,
      o Use it directly,
      o Compile against it in a dynamically linked fashion,
      o Compile against it in a statically linked fashion,

      without the former licensing provided that they:

      o Only append author, project and licensing information to the header.
      o Provide feedback and patches to the original project (for any portable
        changes).
      o Place the header in their code, below their license agreement.
      o Place a new OSI-approved license header in the code file.
        o This license must idemnify all contributors to the code from all
          liabilities.
      
      This exception is bound to the specific version of the file, that version of that
      file is known as affiliated. If the header is removed from the affiliated file, 
      the new version of the file becomes known as removed. All projects that use
      the affiliated file may continue to do so: but are not required to submit
      updates to the originating project. If the originating project re-adds the
      header to the removed file and wishes to obtain updates it must inform all the 
      other projects within MOSA of this action.
      
      Destination projects will not be held responsible for not providing updates
      to a previously removed file if they were not made aware that it became affiliated
      once again.
